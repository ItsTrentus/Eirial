## Campaign Rules / Assumptions

-   The `Rule of Cool` prevails. My main goal is for everyone to have fun. Doing cool things is part of that. Not _all_ things are possible, but if it's feasible - let's try it!
-   Nat 20's do _not_ guarantee success on non-combat rolls. You may still fail, but you'll fail a lot more gracefully.
