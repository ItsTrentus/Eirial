Some more nefarious mortals created "Cults of Destruction" to praise Balth, wontonly destroying anything in their path.

Legends say that waters blessed by the goddess Phymera possess the ability to cure the sick or even slow the process of aging.

    Domains:        Magic, Alchemy, Travel
    Alignment:      True Neutral
    Description:
        Moranth is not often seen, but more so felt.  His presence is felt in all reaches of the mortal plane, and even further beyond.  While all gods and goddesses can bestow their disciples with the gift of the arcane, Moranth prefers his disciples to learn it for themselves.  Magic does not exist in all places, but it can be found in all places should one know how to obtain it.  Most often, wizards, sorcerors, and scholars are those who praise Moranth, hoping to obtain the ability to shape the world around them.

    Symbol: A book levitating in the middle of 5 stars

## Phayra (fay-rah)

    Other Names:    Fayora, The Winged God
    Sex:            Female
    Domains:        Flight, Air, Music
    Alignment:      Good
    Description:
        Phayra is unlike many of her siblings.  Her form, the combination of great eagle, and human woman.  Her upper half, humanoid in nature, but adorned by simple brown wings.  Her lower half morphing to the talons of a great eagle.  Phayra cares little for the mortals, except for their ability to create new and interesting musics.  She is often prayed to as a source of inspiration by many Bards and performers. Legend says that if a performer reaches a new level of skill, that the afterimage of Phayra's wings can be seen faintly as they play.

    Symbol: A winged harp

## Koranth (core-annth)

    Other Names:    Kairth, Koronath
    Sex:            Male
    Domains:        Death, Pain, Corruption
    Alignment:      Lawful Evil
    Description:
        Koranth is the embodiment of death. His gaunt form seems to hover above the ground as he approaches.  Many believe that he is the last figure a mortal sees before they're wisked away to the afterlife.  We know now however, that this isn't true.  Mortals have continued to die long after the gods fell. Legends of old depict Koranth as a stoic figure, taking no joy in his inflictions, yet unwavering in his devotion to complete them. Among cultists, Koranth is the most beloved, wishing pain and death amongst their enemies.  It's unclear whether or not he has ever provided a direct response to his worshipers.

    Symbol: A bloodied sickle

## Lorein (lo-rain)

    Other Names:    Lorien, Loray
    Sex:            Female
    Domains:        Knowledge, Wisdom, Hope
    Alignment:      Good
    Description:
        Lorein scoured the realms with an insatiable thirst for knowledge.  She shared with the mortals who requested it, but sparingly, and after much deliberation.  The wisdom she possessed allowed her some level of clairvoyance, reaching into the minds of her worshippers, to determine their true motivations for seeking knowledge.  Many who are gifted with the arcane arts also seek the goddesses wisdom. Those who do so with pure intent, are given what they seek.  Others, the more common man, often look to Lorein for simple hopes.  That they will survive another winter.  Or for the wisdom to make the correct choice when all options seem to have unknowable consequence.

    Symbol: An owl perched atop a branch

## Zorian (z-or-ee-in)

    Other Names:    Zarian, The Tyrant
    Sex:            Male
    Domains:        Hatred, Trickery, Tyranny
    Alignment:      Evil
    Description:
        Zorian, the other half to twin-sibling Rasheva, lives only to lord over others.  Would thier power permit it, they may have even attempted to take over the throne of the All Father.  He holds loyalty only to those that serve a purpose.  He uses vile, spiteful, trickery to accomplish his deeds, rarely ever putting himself in harms way.  Swindlers, power-hungry lords, and authoritarians with too little empathy find themselves hungering for Zorian's blessing.

    Symbol: An entity lording over others

## Tra'nox (tray-uh-nox)

    Other Names:    Gorth, Toranx
    Sex:            Male
    Domains:        Gluttony, Torment, Glory
    Alignment:      Evil
    Description:
        Tra'nox, the largest, physically of the gods has dedicated himself to hoarding the glory of others.  He feasts upon the accomplishments (and of the bodies) of those that stand in his way.  Offering of food, severed limbs, and stolen trickets of valor often find themselves afoot a statuette of Tra'nox.  Those who wish to gain his favor, often have greed on the mind.  They have much, but wish only for more. If not to benefit themselves, to lord it over their foes.  There are few, and very few, warriors who pray to Tra'nox in hopes that their victories on the battlefield correlate directly glory for themselves.

    Symbol: An animal (pig?) roasting over a flame
