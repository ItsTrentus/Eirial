Agility <--- Something with speed, increasing speed or something temporarily
Strength <--- Something to obviously increase physical prowess. Dunno if it should be a striaght temp stat boost or not
Spirit <--- Not sure on this one, thinking some type of astral projection / spirit walk type ability
Cunning <--- Feeling like this could be getting out of a sticky situation, or creating a path from nowhere. Possibly a travel/teleportation thing?
Fortune <-- Some type of "Luck", with re-rolls
Mind <-- Potentially something that lets a person ignore an effect, like a legendary resistance
Vitality <--- Feel like this one is pretty easily a "heal" type of effect
