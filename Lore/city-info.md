![Griffinbrook - Capital City](../maps/Griffinbrook/Griffinbrook.png)

## Social

Griffinbrook is home to many a race and creature. Gnomes, Elves, Humans, Orcs, Firbolgs, Kenku, etc. They all make their home in Griffinbrook. There is a power dynamic based on wealth within the city howeever. Society is informally split into castes. Day laborers, farmers, etc. all are considered of the lowest rung. Many business men, merchants, and a few researchers sit within the middle class. The military, the Ashcroft family, and the higher ranking clergy of the churches of Otaris and Lorein all fill the upper levels of the caste.

## Political

The inner walls are controlled by Lord Ashcroft and the guard of General Raddock. Lord Ashcroft's ascension to the throne came at a young age, after his father's assassination. The Ashcroft family, and some citizens of Griffinbrook believe that the Ashcroft family is destined to rule, by the grace of the gods. The inner walls of Griffinbrook seem to either believe this, or go along with it to remain out of trouble. Outside the walls however, the lower castes and common workers feel out of touch with the ruling elite, and long for a change in leadership.

## Economic

The primary source of income for Griffinbrook are the taxes that it collects from all of the surrounding cities, towns, and villages. In return, they're offered protection for threats from the outer islands, the north, or even internal issues. Secondary to taxation, Griffinbrook's farmland produces a great deal of grain for the area, making it home to many farmers and brewmasters. The "Ashcroft Ale" is a particularly hearty commodity sought after even in the far reaches beyond Zorian's spine.

## Religious

Griffinbrook is a diverse city. Almost all gods are repsented in some capacity. With the sprawling farmlands around it, Relene sees plenty of praise. To the north lie the Mountains of Moranth, naturally aiding in his recognition within the city. Lord Ashcroft has a personal soft spot for Otaris and Lorein, which in turn means that many of his citizens follow in his footsteps. Temples to Otaris and Lorein are plentiful and small shrines can be found even in some taverns and shops.

## Military

Griffinbrook is home to the primary military force for the realms of Eirial, entitled The Kings Guard. The military accounts for almost 10% of the entire population of Griffinbrook. The military is currently led by General Raddock. Raddock, while gaining in age - is still an intimidating presence, and demands respect.

There is a subset of the military that acts as an "elite force". While the composition and mission of this force is unknown to the general populus, they have been given the nickname "The Red Riders". The Red Riders fall outside the normal scope of military influence, and seem to only take official orders from General Raddock or Lord Ashcroft himself.

## View on Magic

Griffinbrook is no stranger to magic. Many mages are employed by the Ashcroft family to research and provide services for the elite. However, the lower castes are expected to maintain a distance from the practice of magic. Much of it is a gap in knowledge, and a need for control. Those who wish to perform magic within the city must present themselves to the Guard for inspection, designation, and branding. Mages outside of the societal elite typically find themselves branded along the neck or face and, depending on the level of their ability, may have to submit themselves to a "dampening" device of unknown origin, to better control their power.

<summary>Midthorn</summary>

# Midthorn

_Quick Glance_

> Population: ~43,000
> Ruling Figure:
> Current home of the Thorn Guard
> Primarily Humans, Elves, Halflings, and Dwarves
> Rampant crime due to lack of structured power

![Midthorn](../maps/Midthorn/Midthorn.jpg)

### Social

Midthorn is more "open" than most other major cities. If you've got the motivation or the money to make something happen - you can make it happen in Midthorn. There's no clear division as to a ruling class and commoners. The only group that stands out from the rest is the Thorn Guard.

### Political

The city is primarily run by The Thorn Guard, a militia uprising opposing Lord Ashcroft's rule. All of the established King's Guard who were stationed in Midthorn were either kicked out, publically executed, or in hiding amongst the city. The Thorn Guard are in opposition to the Ashcroft's family's sense of divine rule and their harst punishment of magic users. Their goals are rather public, usurp the throne and implement a member of the Thorn Guard. Their methods however are, as of yet, unknown.

### Economic

Trade relations are strained with Midthorn at the moment. Lord Ashcroft has called for a trade embargo, in hopes to starve out the Thorn Guard. While common goods may not ship and and out of Midthorn often, they have become a hub for illegal trade goods. This money, while illegitimate, puts them in step with the capital. Items and services of almost any kind can be found here. Two of the largest draws are something called "The Challenge Arena", and ship captains claiming to know how to access the Floating City. Neither have been verified.

### Religious

Lucience and Balth both hold a special place in the hearts of Midthorn citizens. Many who sail the sea search for fortune, fame, and luck. Those amongst the Thorn Guard pray to Balth to grant them special leeway in any impedning battles with Griffinbrook. There have been others popping up however. The one that's beginning to concern people is the random appearance to altars of Gorth. Their devotees haven't made public their intent, but the citizens concern grows daily.

### Military

The Thorn Guard have taken control of the City. A younger, elven, guard captain by the name of Raymond Vereen sits at the helm. There is no official Governor of Midthorn anymore, he was removed with the rest of the Ashcroft sympathizers. The Thorn Guard's numbers are unknown, but within the city their presence is well known. The Guard use the prisons and fighting pits now for entertainment of torture of those still loyal to Ashcroft. Most "normal" offenses are handled by the people. Their justice often swift and precise, though unmeasured.

### View on Magic

Midthorn appreaches magic with a bit more intrigue, rather than disgust or fear. Many still don't understand it's place in the world, but are coming to understand that it makes day to day life easier in some aspects. While out of the reach for many normal citizens of Midthorn, service merchants have cropped up offering services from the most mundance to the extraordinary. Unless a magical act is seen as a threat to the Thorn Guard, it is often permitted.

<summary>Clovernook</summary>

# Clovernook

_Quick Glance_

> Population: ~63,000
> Governor: Alisha Lightfoot
> Home to many races, most notably Dragonkin (dragonborn)
> Claims the majority of trade from Dracorise, Claw Isles, and the island beneath the floating city.

![Clovernook](../maps/Clovernook/Clovernook.jpg)

### Social

Clovernook, aligned along the western peninsula, is thriving with all sorts of people. The city, second largest in Eirial, is home to most races of the realm. Most notably, Clovernook is home to most Dragonkin (dragonborn) on the mainland. Partly because it is rather close to the Claw Isles and Dracorise, but largly due to the Clovernook Colosseum.

### Political

Governor Lightfoot lays claim to Clovernook. Clovernook's primarily run by the wealthy or those who have proven themselves in the Colosseum. The surrounding areas are full of well maintained farmland, and middle class blue collar peoples. While poverty is an issue everywhere, Clovernook prides itself on being particularly charitable and maintaining a relatively low poverty and crime rate because of that.

### Economic

Clovernook is the primary Eastern trade hub. Most goods that come from Guanoglen, or the southern sections first go through Clovernook. As a result they gain a great deal of their wealth from trade tarriffs and taxes. However, there is a secondary source of income: The Clovernook Colosseum. This is **the** fighting ring of choice for any who truly wish to test their mettle. Thousands of gold have been won and lost wtihin these walls, a small perctentage of which goes to the city itself.

### Religious

Otaris, Lorein and Phayra all find their homes here. The people of Clovernook seem to care deeply for their sport, their play, and their knowledge. Festivals are held here in honor of the gods. Churches here are larger and seem to provide a larger sense of community. Here, especially, the churches will help the downtrodden and broken.

### Military

While rather large, Clovernook doesn't hold a huge army. They hold a contingent, of course. The primary source of "muscle" in Clovernook however comes from the gladiators of the Colosseum. They may be relatively few, but they are mighty. The presence of those military and town guard available is felt however. Streets are often patrolled, and peace kept.

### View on Magic

Clovernook's stance on magic is a bit more open than most. However, they believe that _all_ magic should be as a gift from the gods. Learned magic, and magic given by sources of "evil", are quickly shunned. Those who channel the gods and commit themselves to the churches often find themselves among the more powerful members of society. Thier powers and ability to "commune" with the gods is heavily sought after.

<summary>Crystalbreak</summary>

# Crystalbreak

_Quick Glance_

> Population: ~37,000
> Governor: James Clauthorn
> Relatively diverse racially, more gnomes and dwarves than most larger cities.
> Largest Western trade hub.

![Crystalbreak](../maps/Crystalbreak/Crystalbreak2.jpg)

### Social

As with many port towns, trade brings in all types. Due to it's proximity to Zorian's Spine, many enterprising Dwarves and Gnomes find their way to Crystalbreak. This town is home to many a rougher groups, some pirates, and those who wish to get into black market trade.

### Political

While Governor Clauthorn is in charge of the city as a whole, he is more of a figurehead. The true leaders of Crystalbreak is the Admiral's Court. The Admiral's Court consists of the wealthiest, more enterprising, owners of trade fleets.

### Economic

Crystalbreak makes the majority of it's money from incoming trades. Crystalbreak is also home to many adventerous parties who wish to explore the Siren's Cove. Crystalbreak also dips its hands into blackmarket trade goods. Governor Clauthorn turns a blind eye to the fact, assuming that enough coin is provided. The Admirals Court, while not directly involved, often has ties to many of the trades that occur within the city.

### Religious

Phymera, Luciene, and Rasheva, all hold temples within Crystalbreak. Phymera and Luciene are the most often encountered for good fortune on journies across the seas. Rasheva however has taken hold in the past few decades, often being associated with the black market fare.

### Military

Crystalbreak's military is relatively thin. Clauthorn relies on it's proximity to Griffinbrook and it's relative saftey behind Zorian's Spine for defense. The town guard is lethargic and often paid off. The Admiral's Court provides it's own protection and protection to legitimate business who require it. There is a small contingent of the military that is extremely well armed, well kept, and one of the only sources in the city to outwardly display the use of magic in policing.

### View on Magic

Magic is outlawed within the city. It's use and knowledge resitrcted to those within the governing body, or those who've been given special permission from said governing body.

<summary>Elderberg</summary>

# Elderberg

_Quick Glance_

> Population: ~27,000  
> Governor: Grolosh K'neve
> Home to many Tabaxi and Orc
> Accessed only by sea or the Koranth Desert

![Elderberg](../maps/Elderberg/Elderberg.png)

### Social

Tabaxi and Orcs make up the majority of Elderberg, having the survival instinct or pure grit to make it through the Koranth Desert. Most others make their way to Elderberg via trade ship. Dwarves, gnomes, firbolg, and elves are among the most rare in Elderberg.

### Political

Elderberg is **the** location for traders, merchants, and treasure seekers. While the wealthy most deifnitely control the strings in the city, there is a well established "slum". The slums, while not wealthy, is home to a well organized group of thieves and treasure seekers who care for the well being of the slums themselves.

### Economic

Elderberg's surrounding areas are rich in gem mines. Many of which are hidden in the Koranth Desert. Beyond the gems, Elderberg is known for its high quality silks and massive bazaars.
