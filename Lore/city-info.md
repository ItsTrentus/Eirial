## Social

Griffinbrook is home to many a race and creature. Gnomes, Elves, Humans, Orcs, Firbolgs, Kenku, etc. They all make their home in Griffinbrook. There is a power dynamic based on wealth within the city howeever. Society is informally split into castes. Day laborers, farmers, etc. all are considered of the lowest rung. Many business men, merchants, and a few researchers sit within the middle class. The military, the Ashcroft family, and the higher ranking clergy of the churches of Otaris and Lorein all fill the upper levels of the caste.

## Political

The inner walls are controlled by Lord Ashcroft and the guard of General Raddock. Lord Ashcroft's ascension to the throne came at a young age, after his father's assassination. The Ashcroft family, and some citizens of Griffinbrook believe that the Ashcroft family is destined to rule, by the grace of the gods. The inner walls of Griffinbrook seem to either believe this, or go along with it to remain out of trouble. Outside the walls however, the lower castes and common workers feel out of touch with the ruling elite, and long for a change in leadership.

## Economic

The primary source of income for Griffinbrook are the taxes that it collects from all of the surrounding cities, towns, and villages. In return, they're offered protection for threats from the outer islands, the north, or even internal issues. Secondary to taxation, Griffinbrook's farmland produces a great deal of grain for the area, making it home to many farmers and brewmasters. The "Ashcroft Ale" is a particularly hearty commodity sought after even in the far reaches beyond Zorian's spine.

## Religious

Griffinbrook is a diverse city. Almost all gods are repsented in some capacity. With the sprawling farmlands around it, Relene sees plenty of praise. To the north lie the Mountains of Moranth, naturally aiding in his recognition within the city. Lord Ashcroft has a personal soft spot for Otaris and Lorein, which in turn means that many of his citizens follow in his footsteps. Temples to Otaris and Lorein are plentiful and small shrines can be found even in some taverns and shops.

## Military

Griffinbrook is home to the primary military force for the realms of Eirial. The military accounts for almost 10% of the entire population of Griffinbrook. The military is currently led by General Raddock. Raddock, while gaining in age - is still an intimidating presence, and demands respect.

There is a subset of the military that acts as an "elite force". While the composition and mission of this force is unknown to the general populus, they have been given the nickname "The Red Riders". The Red Riders fall outside the normal scope of military influence, and seem to only take official orders from General Raddock or Lord Ashcroft himself.

## View on Magic

Griffinbrook is no stranger to magic. Many mages are employed by the Ashcroft family to research and provide services for the elite. However, the lower castes are expected to maintain a distance from the practice of magic. Much of it is a gap in knowledge, and a need for control. Those who wish to perform magic within the city must present themselves to the Guard for inspection, designation, and branding. Mages outside of the societal elite typically find themselves branded along the neck or face and, depending on the level of their ability, may have to submit themselves to a "dampening" device of unknown origin, to better control their power.
