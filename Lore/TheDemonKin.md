Gist: Lord Ashcroft is a devine being, who's first wife gave birth to Raymond Vereen.

Eons ago, when the Gods still rested upon their thrones above, an ancient evil reared it's ugly head.
Though powerful in it's own right, this demon dit not possess the ability to directly challenge the gods.
It sought out a creature of wit and pure heart, landing upon a young man of but only 16. The demon did disguise
himself, as a man of grandeur and stature.

"Dear child, with waves of gold, and cheeks of rose,  
Will you listen to what I propose?  
You're young, and weak, your body fragile  
A gift, I offer, life forever after.  
Strength, and poise, the power to lead.  
But listen close, indeed do heed."

The young man, but a farmer's son, destined for nothing more than crops and dust listened intently to the offer.
His eyes filled with dreams, hopes, and glee. The Demon nodded, and set his offer true:

"All these gifts, I grant to you  
In return I'll have my due.  
Letters of crimson, binding of gold  
Read these words in the order told.  
That's all I ask, no less, no more.  
A pleasing story, that's to be sure."

The boy accepted this Demon's book, seven pages of gold and inks of crimson. The words were unknown to him, though it didn't seem to matter.
At the first attempt to utter a word, the words poured from the boy's mouth.

"I seek to bind the powers true,  
to this mortal plane askew.  
Let them walk among the men,  
to live forever with their sin.  
Through deaths untold, their bodies torn  
Forever shall they be reborn."

Not but a moment passed as the words were uttered from the boy's lips and the Demon before him, along with the book had vanished. A cackle heard upon
the air about him.

As the years passed, the boy grew stronger, faster, wiser. He would soon lead men of his own. His reknown known across the lands of Eirial. As those around him
aged and died, he remained untouched by the cruetly of time. He lived two lifetimes before he sought out a witch or truth seer to try to combat his own existence.

"Tell me, Witch, what I must know  
My life, it never seems to slow  
I seek respite from life itself  
I've nothing left but to face death."

The old crone muttered about, face twisted, mouth askew. The flicked her wrist and began to set upon the man with a curse.

"There is but one thing to do,  
Though, I warn you to see it through.  
Lay seed, betroth, and spawn an heir  
The first born son, with snowy hair.  
A perfect babe, in every way  
Save for he'll be your dismay.  
Upon his placement on your throne,  
You shall crumble to dust and bone.  
I wonder though, if you'll succeed  
Or if you'll cast along the deed.  
In your heart, I see the seed,  
The type from which darkness breed."

The man accepted the crone's curse. He would marry, and within two years time have a child. The child was born with perfect complexion, and locks of white.
Though, to his eyes - he saw not but the demon who had given him his gift lifetimes ago. The seed within the man grew, along with it vileness and hatred. Before the
child's first birthday, he beheaded his wife, and cast out the child into the mountains to fend for itself.

Ages passed, the man's appearance changed. A grim, hollow, sort of man though still with the strength of many. He became dark, defensive, and suspicious of all those around him. He acquired a mage who could transform his appearance, allowing him to start his life anew. He left his throne and set out to erase the memory of his past life.

The perfect child, cast out among the snow and stone, and unbeknownst to any... lived. He was taken in by the Great Griffin who lived atop his peaks. The Griffin, initially beliving the child to be an offering swooped in to claim it. He was stopped however, as he saw the beauty of the child. He saw something more than the mere mortal babe before him. He saw a glimpse, in those golden eyes, of a savior.
